Installation
------------

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.upload`` to the list of eggs to
   install ::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.upload

2. You may need to extend a five.grok known good set (KGS) to make sure that
   you get the right versions of the packages that make up five.grok ::

    [buildout]
    ...
    extends =
        http://good-py.appspot.com/release/five.grok/1.2.0-1

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.

Check the box next to ''collective.upload'' and click the 'Activate' button.

Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
